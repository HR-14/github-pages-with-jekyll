Geothermal energy is the energy stored in the center of our planet Earth.
It is viable to utilize this type of energy where the solid layer or Earth crust is thinner.
That is why you can find geothermal exploitations near the tectonic plates borders and near volcanic sites.
The geothermal "deposit" or reservoir is a subsoil volume whose heat energy can be exploited profitably.
There is a whole branch of engineering, called "Reservoir engineering", which through monitoring and computer-assisted modeling,
continiously secure that the field development plan and the geothermal fluid extraction and reinjection take into account
not only the present optimization but the future (30-years or so) as well, making the reservoir utilization sustainable.
